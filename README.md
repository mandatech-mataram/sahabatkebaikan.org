# Sahabatkebaikan.org Website

# Introduction

SahabatKebaikan.org is the first open source live crowdfunding platform. SahabatKebaikan in English means good friend in good things.

# Why we publish our code?
 
As the name implies, we want to build an ecosystem of friendship, involving as many people as possible. Making our code public will make as many people as possible to be involved in this friendship project. Other than that, by publishing our code, we will make our ecosystem to be as accountable as possible. 

# Why we use English here?

Programmers used to read documentation in English. Programmers used to ask/answer questions in stackoverflow using English. English is everywhere in programmer's world. Even the language is written in English.
